Create a new file for the service by running the command sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my_script.service in the terminal. You can replace "my_script" with any name you want to give to the service.

In the text editor that opens, add the following lines to the file:


[Unit]
Description=My Python Script
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Replace "My Python Script" with a description of your script, and replace "/path/to/your/script.py" with the actual path to your Python script.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service by running the command sudo systemctl daemon-reload.

Enable the service to run at boot time by running the command sudo systemctl enable my_script.service. Replace "my_script" with the name of your service.

Start the service by running the command sudo systemctl start my_script.service. This will start the Python script.

You can check the status of the service by running the command sudo systemctl status my_script.service.
